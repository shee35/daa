## Problem Statement
Without using recursion, implement max/min search.

---
## How to use code
Download the source code and run it on any gcc compiler machine. It will ask you for the size of the array and print the result by random generated arrays values by displaying the minimum and maximu element from the array. 
```
#Download project
git clone https://github.com/shee35/daa 
```
* Then get into the folder Assignment 3
* Run the code using any gcc compiler

**Test case**

Test Case-1
Input  
```
Enter the size
10
```

Output
```
The array is: 

6180 19471 2436 16245 9447 10293 26380 25910 15324 235

Maximum element is 26380
Minimum element is 235
```

Test Case-2
Input  
```
Enter the size
25
```

Output
```
The array is: 

8760 23800 24892 20822 31497 32217 27616 7122 17817 25694 6392 22749 3777 8265 22087 10235 32134 27617 9998 10555 29768 6224 28380 27836 21053

Maximum element is 32217
Minimum element is 3777
```

## **Theory**
According to the given problem statement, we had to find the maximum and minimum element of the array. Here we have to apply search for the maximum and the minimum of all the element in the array.This problem can be solved in the two different methods i.e Recursive and Iterative, but as stated in the problem we have only discussed the iterative version of the algorithm. So, basically for this problem we can have many algorithm but only the most popular and the most acceptable algorithm are discussed in the paper. Also we have discussed the time and space complexity of all the different algorithms used and accordingly came up with the best suitable algorithm for the problem.

## **Analysis**

**Time Complexity**
Here, we go through the complete array and checks for the smallest or the largest number as compared to the previously initialised variables to store the maximum and the minimum elements. So, as we go through the array once completely the time complexity of this algorithm is O(N).


**Space Complexity**

As for this algorithm we are not using any memory
so the space complexity for this is O(1).
